### A web application that finds all the bad people who don't follow you back

With the help of [this](https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python) Instagram API, I managed to build a web application which can filter out all the bad people who don't follow you back.

##
### Future plans:
- [ ] **IMPORTANT** Adding some sort of security
- [ ] Storing all the *followers* in a Trie structure to speed up checking if a *following* is a *follower*
